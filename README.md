# Unmanned-Ground-Robot-with-FireBase-IOT-Server
An unmanned vehicle with a robotic arm mounted on top which can be controlled remotely using a VR headset and a special hand glove equipped with accelerometer, Gyro, Flex sensors to control movement of the robotic arm and the vehicle. All communication between the operator and the vehicle is carried out using Google FireBase as an IOT server 

You will need to build a 4x4 Vehicle mounter with a 6DOF Robotic arm.
Upload the reciver codes to the NodeMCU microcontroller present on your BOT
and upload the transimitter code to the Glove worn by user.

The glove should have 3 Acclerometers, 3 GyroScopes, 5 flex Sensors to map the postion of your hand and each of your fingers in 3D Space.
